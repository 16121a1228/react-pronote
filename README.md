# ProGrad Lab | REACT - PRONOTE

## Learning Goals

In this exercise, the goal is to apply various higher order functions in react:

- when and how to setup react in your application,
- learn component and basic state management in react.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone this repo

Whenever you create a first significant change, you should make your first commit.

3. Follow these [guidelines to add, commit and push changes](https://github.com/FACEPrep-ProGrad/general-guidelines-labs-project-builders.git).

In the end of this document, you will find guidelines on how to submit the exercise.

### Introduction

In this exercise, you will try to work with component and state. 

create a new react app using the following command
```
npx create-react-app pronote
cd pronote
```
Now go to your app.js and remove the unnecessary code. Your app.js should be looking similar to the this.
```
import React from 'react';
import HigherOrderFunctions from './components/hof/HigherOrderFunctions';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
 
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now create a folder called components inside the src folder and create a component called Editor.jsx file. Once you create it you are good to go.
**Note: use rcc to generate the code template**.  

So let's get started!
